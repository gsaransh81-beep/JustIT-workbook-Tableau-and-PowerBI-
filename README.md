## 🚀 Project Overview

Across four days of tasks, I worked with multiple datasets and tools, including Tableau, Spotify data, Healthcare data, and Power BI Desktop. The workbook showcases my skills in:

1.Data visualization and storytelling

2.Dashboard creation

3.Data analysis for insights

4.Applying analytics to real-world decision-making
